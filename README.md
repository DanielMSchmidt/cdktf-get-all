# CDKTF get all

An example project to show how to use `@cdktf/cli-core` to build a version of `cdktf get` that emits all languages instead of one. This can be useful to build construct libraries, but we are not yet sure if it's the best way to solve this problem.

Treat this as an experiment / potentially unmaintained example.

## Usage

Change the `modules.json` file and add the modules of your liking. Then run:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
